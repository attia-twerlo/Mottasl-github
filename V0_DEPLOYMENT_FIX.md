# V0/Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Current Issue
404 errors when refreshing on routes other than `/` in V0 environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced vercel.json Configuration
- Specific route rewrites for all app routes
- Fallback pattern for any unmatched routes
- Located in: `public/vercel.json`

### 2. Build Configuration
- Enhanced Vite config copies deployment files to dist
- Better chunking for SPA routing
- Asset optimization

### 3. Multiple Deployment Config Support
- Netlify: `public/_redirects`  
- Vercel: `public/vercel.json`
- Apache: `public/.htaccess`

## V0 Specific Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Clear V0 Cache**: Force a fresh deployment
2. **Check Build Output**: Ensure vercel.json is in dist folder
3. **Verify Routes**: Test each route directly

### If Still Not Working:
1. **Manual Route Creation**: Use the build-spa.sh script
2. **Explicit Fallbacks**: Create index.html copies in route folders
3. **Check V0 Logs**: Look for specific error messages

### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Build with deployment configs
npm run build

# Manual SPA setup (if needed)
./build-spa.sh

# Test routes locally
npm run preview
```

## Routes That Should Work:
- `/` - Homepage âœ“
- `/campaigns` - Campaigns page
- `/campaigns/create` - Create campaign
- `/campaigns/settings` - Campaign settings  
- `/campaigns/templates` - Templates
- `/campaigns/ai-bots` - AI Bots
- `/contacts` - Contacts page
- `/contacts/create` - Create contact
- `/contacts/[id]` - Contact details
- `/analytics` - Analytics page
- `/messages` - Messages page
- `/notifications` - Notifications
- `/settings` - Settings page

## Debug Steps for V0:
1. Open browser dev tools
2. Navigate to any route (e.g., `/campaigns`)
3. Refresh the page
4. Check Network tab for 404 responses
5. Look for console errors

If issues persist, the manual route creation script should resolve it.
